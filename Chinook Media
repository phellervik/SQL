#In this SQL, I'm quering a database with multiple tables quantifying statistics about customers and order data.  

#1. Customers from the US:  
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country= "USA";

#2. Invoices from the US: 
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
on inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "USA";

#3. Employees who are IT Staff:
SELECT * FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title = "IT Staff" ; 

#4. Information for all Invoices and Customers:
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#5. Total Sales for 2010:
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2010-12-31';

#6. Purchased Tracks and Invoices:
SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;

#7.Total Sales by each Sales Agent:
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

#8. Most Sales from Sales agent in 2010: 
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2010%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
